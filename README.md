# Soil Moisture Sensor

This project just collects moisture data of your soil to help you better take care of your plants.

Below shows how data gets transferred from the soil sensor to [Influx Data](https://www.influxdata.com/). Influx data will serve both as part of the middleware layer that hosts all the data and also the application layer to help users interact with the data via its dashboard feature.

## Steps

#### 1 - Create a InfluxData Account

Based off of instructions from [Random Nerd Tutorials](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp8266-nodemcu-influxdb/)

1. Create a influx data cloud account: [InfluxDB Cloud](https://cloud2.influxdata.com/signup)
   
   ![InfluxDB Account](https://i0.wp.com/randomnerdtutorials.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/InfluxDB-create-account.png?resize=431%2C826&quality=100&strip=all&ssl=1)

2. Select where to save your data

3. Select the free plan
   
   ![InfluxDB select plan](https://i0.wp.com/randomnerdtutorials.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Influx-DB-Select-Plan.png?resize=746%2C664&quality=100&strip=all&ssl=1)

4. Create a Bucket.
   
   On the left side panel, click **Load Data** then click **Buckets**
   
   ![](README.assets/2022-12-11-12-39-26-image.png)
   
   Then click the **Create Bucket** button on the right
   
   ![](README.assets/2022-12-11-12-40-25-image.png)
   
   You'll give your bucket a name then click on the **Create** button ?ÔøΩÔøΩ
   
   ![](README.assets/2022-12-11-12-41-03-image.png)

5. Collect the influx DB credentials
   
   Go to **Sources** then scroll down and click **Python**
   
   ![](README.assets/2022-12-11-13-44-15-image.png)
   
   Copy your token from the **Tokens** section and other information listed below from the **Initialize Client Section**
   
   - INFLUX_TOKEN
   
   - INFLUX_ORG
   
   - INFLUX_URL
   
   - INFLUX_BUCKET
     
     ![](README.assets/2022-12-11-13-46-14-image.png)

#### 2 - Setup Config file for WIO Terminal

1. Copy `template.h` file as `config.h` in the same parent folder
   
   ```bash
   cd <path_to_repo>/is-my-soil-moist/soil_moisture_terminal/src/
   cp template.h config.h
   ```
   
   ![](README.assets/2022-12-15-18-40-36-image.png)

2. Replace the following values in your `config.h` file with the appropriate ones
   
   - `<YOUR_WIFI_ID>`
   
   - `<YOUR_WIFI_PASSWORD>`
   
   - `<YOUR_GUID>`
   
   ![](README.assets/2022-12-15-18-41-44-image.png)

#### 2 - Upload code to WIO Terminal

1. Connect your Wio Terminal to your Computer with a USB-C Cable
2. Turn on your Wio Terminal
3. Hit the upload button on Platform IO

#### 3 - Run Python MQTT Forwarder Code

1. Clone the repo
   
   ```bash
   git clone 
   ```

2. Install the following libraries
   
   ```bash
   pip3 install
   ```

3. Run the following code
   
   ```bash
   python3
   ```

Refer the the appendix section for a great time

## Appendix

#### Install a MQTT Broker on the Raspberry Pi

If you want to use your own MQTT Broker hosted on the Raspberry Pi instead of the public mosquitto

. broker.

1. First install
   
   ```bash
   sudo apt get update
   sudo apt install mosquitto mosquitto-clients
   sudo reboot
   ```

2. Test your installation
   
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl enable mosquitto
   ```

3. Edit the `mosquitto.conf` file
   
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf
   ```
   
   Replace
   
   ```
   include_dir /etc/mosquitto/conf.d
   ```
   
   with
   
   ```
   allow_anonymous true
   listener 1883
   ```

4. Restart mosquitto service.
   
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart mosquitto
   ```
   
   The configuration should be applied and the broker will listen on port 1883.

5. To test if you are able to publish/subscribe to your MQTT Broker. Use another computer connected to the same local network.
   
   ```bash
   sudo apt install mosquitto-clients
   ```
   
   Subscribe to a topic in one terminal window
   
   ```bash
   mosquitto_sub  -h <raspberry_pi_ip_address> -p 1883 -v -t test/message
   ```
   
   Publish to the topic in another terminal window. Replace `<raspberry pi ip address> ` with your rasp pi ip address
   
   ```bash
   mosquitto_pub -h <raspberry_pi_ip_address> -t test/message -m 'Hello World!'
   ```
   
   You should be able to see a response from the subscribe terminal window! This was my output
   
   ```bash
   test/message Hello World!
   ```

If you're running into trouble with the test above. you may be experiencing some firewall issues. You can refer to this stack overflow post: [**Stack Overflow - mosquito server refuses connections**](https://askubuntu.com/questions/1121524/mosquito-server-refuses-connections-ubuntu-18-04) .
